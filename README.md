With features such as ingredient search, recipe filters, and nutritional data, users can easily plan and prepare nutritious meals that meet their dietary requirements. The app also offers personalised recipe recommendations and the ability to save customised compilations of favourite recipes. The Recipe Finder is developed using Agile methodology, Gantt charts, and continuous user feedback, and aims to streamline the recipe discovery process by utilising existing recipe databases. Our objective is to create a visually appealing, intuitive, and user-friendly solution that meets the needs of our target audience.
